**Please following the instructions precisely!**

For this homework, you will be using the "Cameras" dataset, which can be downloaded in csv form from: 
<p style="text-align: center;">https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/eagan/class/igr204/datasets</p>
The following questins will build on each other. Your answers should be text file called "homework.txt" consisting of answers to the following questions. If a question has multiple parts, separate the answers with commas. Its contents might look something like this (my answers are wrong!):

`1. 5` </br>
`2. 'Toshiba PDR-T10'` </br>
`3. 100, 10, 1000` </br>
`(and so on)`

1. Examine the dataset using command line arguments (head, tail, less...). Load the data into a numpy array called "cameras". How many of the cameras were manufactured after 1999 (2000 and on)?

2. Create a new array, cameras_new, containing only cameras manufactured after 1999. What is the name of the heaviest camera (weight includes batteries)?

3. What is the mean price of a camera manufactured after 1999? What is the lowest price? What is the highest?

4. Examine the max resolution and release date values in "cameras". How many cameras have non realistic max resolution or release date values?

5. Remove the non realistic data points from "cameras". Find a linear fit y = a x + b, where x is release date and y is max resolution. What is a? What is b?
